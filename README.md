Proposed Layers:

Native compilers (scalac, javac, protoc)
Nix derivation templates
Simple convention of nix files and named derivations
Build Server Protocol for the above set of nix conventions (https://github.com/scalacenter/bsp)
LSP via Metals configured against the custom build server (https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/build-tools/new-build-tool.html#custom-build-server)
Any editor
